## API
### Plugin settings
By default, the plugin sends a mail to all registered users of a blog on new posts or comments, except a user disables the functionality for itself (opt-out). As of version 0.0.5 you can change this behaviour to opt-in with the filter ```iac_default_opt_in``` :
```php
add_filter( 'iac_default_opt_in', '__return_true' );
```
Make shure, this code runs on the action ```plugins_loaded``` with a priority lower than 10 or earlier.

With version 0.0.5 the plugin got settings (Settings→Reading). The one new option allows you to send all emails with the Bcc-header to hide users email-addresses to all other recipients. This option is disabled by default. You have access to the default settings via the filter ```iac_default_options```. An array is passed to this funktion with the key ```send_by_bcc```. Change the value to '1' and return the array on your callback function.

### User settings handling
To change the users settings (inform about posts, inform about comments) use the action ```iac_save_user_settings``` like this:
```php
do_action(
	'iac_save_user_settings',
	$user_id,
	$inform_about_posts, # '1', '0' or NULL if the user didn't changed anything
	$inform_about_comments # '1', '0' or NULL if the user didn't changed anything
);
```
Getting the current user settings is also easy:
```php
$user_settings = apply_filters( 'iac_get_user_settings', array(), $user_id );
```
